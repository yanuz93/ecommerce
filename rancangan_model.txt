What are needed?
What can they do?
Tell me the logic behinds:

- Authentication :
	- need to get client-key

- Admin : can do anything

- Customer : (can order, pay, update debet, edit detail)
	- username (need to be unique?)
	- email (has to be unique!)
	- address

- Seller : (can add goods, update or delete, receive invoice order, receive payment, 
	- username
	- email (has to be unique)
	- 

- Products : (forbidden_goods, public, vip_only(optional), can only be added by admin or seller)
	- name (hasn't to be unique)
	- price
	- quantity
	- weight

- Cart : (can have many products from many sellers, will be deleted after checkout, skipped when checkout clicked)
	- products_id
	-
